In this project, months end after 30 days.
This project takes two dates as input and gives us the magnitude between them in days, months and if long enough, years. This project was a bit difficult to make as it operates on many incrementations but with the right logic under control, I managed to pull it off.
When years are displayed zero, it means that it wont take any amount of years from one date to the other.
This project also decides which date is atwhat order, for better code functionality.

any suggestions are appreciated.
